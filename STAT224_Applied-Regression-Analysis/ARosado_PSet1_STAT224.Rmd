## (a) Read in data and summarize 

See instructions on the HW assignment.

A glimpse of the data:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
mydata <- read.csv("http://statistics.uchicago.edu/~burbank/data/sevengr.csv")
glimpse(mydata)
n <- nrow(mydata)
```

The data are gender and educational measurements on $n=`r n`$ seventh grade students.

I did not type in the number `r n` above.
Instead, I read it right from the data and 
incorporated the data result directly within my report.
Take a look inside the R Markdown file to see how I did that.

I added a couple blank lines above.
Take a look inside the R Markdown file to see how I did that.
...and let me know if you find a better way to insert blank space in markdown.

**Blank space can be insrted into a markdown by placing two spaces at the end of a text, hereby inserting a blank line between paragraphs. Additionally, HTML can be used--the & nbsp; code is readily available.**

Here are the first 8 observations and the names of the columns (variables):

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(mydata, 8)
```




**I put a page break here**
...so the data summary below was not split across two pages --
watch out for this issue and avoid it!
Take a look inside the R Markdown file to see how I did that.

\newpage

And here is another summary a little different from `glimpse`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(mydata)
```

## (b) Answer the HW question about the GPA variable.

Read the question on the HW assignment.

The GPA variable consists of values that are far too high; the highest achievable GPA at the University of Chicago is 4.0. This variable has likely been inflated by some multiplier or other means of universally increasing magnitude. 

## (c) Numerical summaries

See instructions are on the HW assignment.

First, I will demonstrate labeling output, showing output, and commenting
on output ...just as you will do for part (c) farther below.

Average IQ score by gender:
```{r echo=FALSE}
mean(IQ ~ Gender, data = mydata)
```
The boys in the the seventh grade class averaged a little
higher than the girls on an IQ test.

I wrote "Average IQ score by gender" above my R code
and then wrote a comment afterward about the results.
So, there was no need to display the R code: `mean(IQ ~ Gender, data = mydata)`.

**Be sure you know how to hide R code when it makes sense to do so 
(most of the time).**

Now, see part (c) in the HW assignment explaining what you are asked to do here.

Of course, you will describe here what you plan to display below.
```{r echo=FALSE}
median(IQ ~ Gender, data = mydata) # IQ by gender
median(GPA ~ Gender, data = mydata) # GPA by gender
```
Then, comment here on what you learn from the output of your R code above:
Males in the seventh grade class have a slightly higher median IQ than girls, but maintain a marginally lower median GPA than do girls. Information on median IQ keeps with the previously gathered info on mean IQ.

**CONTINUE TO THE NEXT PAGE TO PRACTICE WITH GRAPHICS.**

## (d) Right-size these graphs 

Instructions are on the HW assignment.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- gf_histogram(~ IQ, data = mydata, color = "white", bins = 15)
p2 <- gf_boxplot(IQ ~ Gender, data = mydata)
p3 <- gf_point(GPA ~ IQ | Gender, data = mydata)
p4 <- gf_point(GPA ~ IQ, data = mydata, color = ~Gender, size = ~SelfConcept, alpha = 0.4)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

## (e) Modify the graphs and insert here

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- gf_histogram(~ SelfConcept, data = mydata, color = "white", bins = 15)
p2 <- gf_boxplot(SelfConcept ~ Gender, data = mydata)
p3 <- gf_point(SelfConcept ~ GPA | Gender, data = mydata)
p4 <- gf_point(SelfConcept ~ GPA, data = mydata, color = ~Gender, size = ~IQ, alpha = 0.4)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

```{R echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '~/Desktop/CLASSES/STAT224/PSets/HW1')
```
